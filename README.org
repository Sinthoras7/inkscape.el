#+TITLE:   inkscape.el
#+DATE:    November 7, 2020

Use ~M-x inkscape~ (or ~M-x ink~) to
1. Query for a file name to edit from the figure directory (~./figures/~ by default)
2. If the file does not exist, create it from the template (stored in
   ~inkscape-plain-svg-template~, by default the contents of ~template.svg~)
3. Open Inkscape (asynchronically) on the file
4. Once the process exits, compile the file to ~pdf_tex~ by default (controlled
   by ~inkscape-compilation-args~)
5. Check that the target file exists. If it does, copy the include string
   (~\incfig{%s}~ by default).
