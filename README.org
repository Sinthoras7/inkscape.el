#+TITLE:   inkscape.el
#+DATE:    November 7, 2020

Use ~M-x inkscape~ (or ~M-x ink~) to
1. Query for a file name to edit from the figure directory (~./figures/~ by default)
2. If the file does not exist, create it from the template (stored in
   ~inkscape-plain-svg-template~, by default the contents of [[file:template.svg]])
3. Open Inkscape (asynchronically) on the file
4. Once the process exists, compile the file to ~pdf_tex~ by defalut (contolled
   by ~inkscape-compilation-args~)
5. Check that the target file exists. If it does, copy the include string
   (~\def\svgwidth{0.7\textwidth} \input{./figures/%s.pdf_tex}~ by default).

Doom Emacs recipe:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package! inkscape
  :recipe (:host github
           :repo "ymarco/inkscape.el"
           :files ("*.el" "*.svg")))
#+end_src
